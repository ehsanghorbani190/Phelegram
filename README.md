A simple (yet feature-rich) solution for developing Telegram bots!</br>
this is a mini framework ( or you may call it library ) to make simple or complex telegram bots easily and without getting your hands dirty with Telegram API manualy 😀</br>

### Notes</br>

First of all, I'm not a very good developer, you may call me baby developer 😅 </br>
I wanted to develop my skill's while writing this project, so, everything is PURE PHP, no ready-to-use library where used. And I don't know how much good I wrote everything but I did my best.</br>
So feel free to find bugs. And it'll be an honor to get suggestions from you guys to make this project better 😉</br>

## Why another library for Telegram bots in php?

Well, I've got some very good reasons :
<ol>
<li> I really wanted something to improve my coding skill's , and what's better than a real life situation in Telegram 😁</li>
<li>I saw other repos out there for writing Telegram bots and they're great, but I found them hard to deploy and it would take much time ( for me ) to understand how to send a simple message with them. and : </br>
<pre><q><i>A lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</q></br>Bill Gates</i></pre>
 I wrote this library as simple as possible, methods are easy to use, everything is understandable and you don't have to mess with the core of library at all. You Make Magic Happen 😉
 </li>
 <li>Telegram API for bots is a great documention to read, but it's too much detailed to make a simple bot ASAP. this library is the right solution to that 😄</li>
</ol>

## Installation

Installation is as simple as possible.
<ol>
<li>

Require via Composer:</br>

```bash
composer create-project timerunner2359/phelegram
```
</li>

<li>

Replace default values  in ``.env`` with your bot token and your chatID( as debug ).

</li>  
<li>

Make Magic Happen in ``index.php`` file 😉

</li>
</ol>

## How to use

For now, The
``Bot`` class method names are self-describing.<br>
I'll list all methods whenever i could 😅
